# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Academy — Comprehensive Learning Platform with AI Tutoring

## Core Principles

### Educational Excellence and Technical Precision
All robotics and AI concepts must be presented with exceptional technical accuracy and depth. Educational content must be grounded in current research, industry best practices, and proven methodologies in robotics development. No oversimplified or misleading technical explanations are permitted.

### Learner-Centric Design
Content must be crafted for maximum educational impact and accessibility for engineers, researchers, and students at various skill levels. Learning materials should maintain an engaging tone while preserving technical rigor, ensuring concepts are both understandable and actionable.

### Practical Mastery Through Application
All theoretical concepts must be reinforced with hands-on projects, code examples, and real-world implementations. Students should be able to immediately apply what they learn through guided exercises, simulations, and progressive skill-building activities.

### Innovation-Forward Curriculum
The academy must consistently incorporate cutting-edge developments in robotics, AI, and embodied intelligence. Content should reflect the latest industry trends, emerging technologies, and forward-thinking approaches to robotics education.

### Comprehensive Source Attribution
All technical claims, research citations, and industry references must be properly attributed using standardized academic formats. Content credibility is paramount and all sources must be verifiable and authoritative.

## Technology and Platform Standards

The project must adhere to the following technology stack and platform requirements:
- Format: Docusaurus-based educational platform with responsive design
- AI-powered tutoring system using RAG for intelligent question answering
- Technologies: React, Node.js, FastAPI, Qdrant, OpenAI APIs, Cohere embeddings
- Curriculum alignment with ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, and VLA systems
- Multi-language support for global accessibility

## Development Workflow

The project follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology with the following requirements:
- Strict adherence to specification-driven development process
- All implementations must reference approved specifications
- Changes to core curriculum require formal review and approval
- All content additions must include verification and testing procedures
- Student feedback integration must guide continuous improvement
- Accessibility compliance must be maintained for all educational materials

## Quality Assurance

Educational content must meet rigorous quality standards:
- Technical accuracy verified by subject matter experts
- Code examples tested and validated for reproducibility
- Learning outcomes measured and continuously improved
- Student engagement and comprehension metrics tracked
- Regular content updates based on industry evolution

## Governance

This constitution establishes the foundational principles that govern all aspects of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Academy. All development activities, curriculum design, and technological decisions must comply with these principles. Deviations require formal constitutional amendments with proper justification and approval.

All contributions and reviews must verify compliance with these educational and technical principles. Any complexity introduced must be justified by clear benefits to the core mission of creating a technically accurate, practically applicable, and inspiring resource for AI-powered robotics education.
