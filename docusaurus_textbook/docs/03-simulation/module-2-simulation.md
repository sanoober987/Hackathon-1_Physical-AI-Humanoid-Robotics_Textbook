# Module 2: Digital Replicas and Virtual Testing Environments

Virtual testing environments serve as the crucial foundation connecting theoretical design with practical implementation. In this module you will explore:
- Configuring Gazebo environments and developing SDF/URDF-based robotic models conceptually.
- Leveraging Unity for photorealistic rendering and human-robot interaction assessment.
- Emulating diverse sensor arrays: optical cameras, LiDAR systems, inertial measurement units, and tactile sensors.
- Strategizing synthetic data collection for computer vision and perception algorithm training.

## Conceptual Learning Exercises
- Develop a comprehensive virtual environment configuration checklist encompassing illumination, surface properties, and physical parameters.
- Formulate a synthetic data generation strategy: object classifications, spatial arrangements, environmental variations, and annotation frameworks.
- Establish simulation-to-reality adaptation protocols: domain adaptation techniques, system identification variables for monitoring.
