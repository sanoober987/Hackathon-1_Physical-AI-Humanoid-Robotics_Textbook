# Module 3: Physical Components and Edge Computing Systems

## System Configuration Guidelines (Conceptual)

### Development Workstation Specifications (Preferred)
- Graphics Processing Unit: NVIDIA RTX series with substantial VRAM capacity
- Central Processing Unit: multi-core processor from recent generation
- Memory Capacity: 32–64 GB system memory suggested
- Operating System: Ubuntu Long Term Support distribution

### Embedded AI Systems: Jetson Orin Platforms (Conceptual)
- Deploy Jetson hardware for machine learning inference and real-time computational tasks.
- Peripheral equipment inventory: Intel RealSense cameras, USB microphone arrays, power regulation systems, high-performance storage media.

## Robotic Platform Alternatives (Conceptual)
- Surrogate Methodology: utilize quadrupedal robots or manipulator arms as surrogates for humanoid algorithm validation.
- Compact Humanoid Platforms for kinematic principle demonstration.
- Advanced Humanoid Systems for simulation-to-reality deployment preparation.

## Acquisition and Financial Planning Considerations
- Compile a comprehensive equipment catalog featuring estimated pricing, performance trade-offs, and baseline technical specifications.
